# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/plan-template.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [e.g., library/cli/web-service/mobile-app/compiler/desktop-app or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- `Result<T>` response envelope, `@Valid` request validation, and versionless API
  paths are identified for every HTTP contract in scope.
- Business logic placement is consistent with `controller -> service ->
  repository`, and the design introduces no database queries inside loops.
- Domain data rules are captured: snake_case database mapping, camelCase Java
  fields, `Long` amount values in cents, and encryption/hash lookup treatment
  for sensitive fields.
- Operational rules are covered: SLF4J logging, `traceId` + `bizOrderNo` at key
  business nodes, `GlobalExceptionHandler` coverage, and externalized
  configuration.
- Verification plan includes the exact commands and tests required to keep
  `mvn test`, `mvn clean package -DskipTests`, and `mvn checkstyle:check`
  green.

**Structure Decision**: Keep a single Spring Boot service with the canonical
package layout above. Feature plans MUST reference the real package paths they
touch instead of introducing alternate structures.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
